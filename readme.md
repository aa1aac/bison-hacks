## Inspiration
Growing up with a close friend with autism, I have experienced how he often find it hard to recognize, manage emotions as well as connect with many people. We realized that there are many children and adults out there with autism and according to CDC, black children in DMV are 1.4times more likely to have autism. Also, parenting would be lot easier if new parents can be able to connect with experienced parents and children with autism could connect with other children with autism and developing their connection abilities.


We built it using:
1. Django
2. javascript
3. CSS
4. HTML

Challenges:
1. Finding games that are designed for and comprehensible to children with autism. 
2. Hosting our website.

What's next?
-> We plan to make speech aid for children with autism that would help them navigate our website and help them communicate with us and others easily. 
-> We plan to make our games for children with autism.
-> We plan to partner with autism centres around the country.
